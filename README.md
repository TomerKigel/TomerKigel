Hello there,

My name is Tomer and this is my git!

I am a software developer since my early adulecense (have started somewhere around 14 years ago). 

In the beginning, I was preoccupied with thoughts about the ideal MMO action game instead of putting hard effort into school.
I was contemplating what would constitute the best player experience in a competitive open-world environment. What I was lacking in skill and knowledge I was compensating with imagination and fantasies. Fast-forward a couple of years I found I was more interested in the journey of making something interesting instead of the product itself. The freedom I felt in my fantasies seemed to be realized better in my ambitious work to make things happen.
This git is my playground, a place you are welcome to join me on my quest to find freedom and joy in problem-solving and designing systems and solutions.
